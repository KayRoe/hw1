            My name is Senait which means good things or blessings in my language. 
        </p>
            I am Habesha, which is a general term we use to call our people in Ethiopia and Eritrea.
        <p>
            I grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. I like to paint, swim, read and meditate when I have time.

            I also like to travel. I paint abstract pieces as well as landscape. 
            My favourite author is Paulo Coelho.
